Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I’m Lucca Labattaglia, an Electronics Engineering student pursuing a double major in Cybersecurity. My passions lie at the intersection of math, programming, and problem-solving, with a healthy dose of sports and general health.

🔍 About Me

I’ve been programming in C++ for over three years and consider myself proficient, especially after developing several significant personal projects. My current focus is on contributing to open-source projects (and starting my own!), but I aim to hone my skills further before diving into collaborations. Quality is my priority, and I want to make sure every line of code I contribute is meaningful.

Here’s what drives me:
	•	Math Enthusiast: I enjoy solving complex problems and applying theory to practical scenarios (still            learning, but loving the journey).
	•	Cybersecurity Aspirant: Breaking, building, and securing systems fascinates me, and I’m diving deeper into     understanding how to design resilient architectures.
	•	Tinkerer: Whether it’s coding, debugging hardware, or exploring new tools like FPGA programming or             Verilog, I love getting hands-on.

💻 Skills
	•	Programming Languages: C++, C, Verilog, SystemVerilog, ARM64 Assembly, MATLAB, R, and Lua.
	•	Tools: KiCad, EAGLE, VSCode, Git, and more.
	•	Areas of Expertise: System design, FPGA programming, and machine learning, paired with strong teamwork and     communication skills.

🤝 Collaborate with Me

I’m here to learn and grow. If you spot anything odd in my code or think I could improve something, please reach out—constructive feedback is invaluable.

I’m currently focusing on:
	•	Building and maintaining personal projects to refine my skills.
	•	Exploring and contributing to open-source initiatives once I feel ready to make a significant impact.
